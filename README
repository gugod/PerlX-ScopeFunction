DESCRIPTION

    Scope functions are helper functions that helps to constraint the use
    of an given expression, to make the boundray look clearer, usually by
    making a inner lexical scope.

 with (EXPR) BLOCK

    The with keyword can be used to bring the result of an given EXPR to a
    smaller scope (code block):

        with ( EXPR ) BLOCK

    The EXPR are evaluated in list context, and the result (a list) is
    available inside BLOCK as @_. The conventional topic variable $_ is
    also assigned the last value of the list ($_[-1]).
