=head1 NAME

PerlX::ScopeFunction -- new keywords for creating scopes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use C<with> keyword to constraint the use result of the given
expression to a smaller lexical scope.

    with ( grep { $_ % 2 == 0 } @input ) {
        my @even_nums = @_;

        say "There are " . scalar(@even_nums) . " even numbers";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scope functions are helper functions that helps to constraint the use
of an given expression, to make the boundray look clearer, usually by
making a inner lexical scope.

=head2 C<with> (EXPR) BLOCK

The C<with> keyword can be used to bring the result of an given EXPR
to a smaller scope (code block):

    with ( EXPR ) BLOCK

The EXPR are evaluated in list context, and the result (a list) is
available inside BLOCK as C<@_>. The conventional topic variable C<$_>
is also assigned the last value of the list (C<$_[-1]>).
