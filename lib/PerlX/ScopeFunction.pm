=head1 NAME

PerlX::ScopeFunction - new keywords for creating scopes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use List::MoreUtils qw( part );
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction qw( let with );

    with ( part { $_ % 2 } @input ) {
        my ($evens, $odds) = @_;
        say "There are " . scalar(@$evens) . " even numbers: " . join(" ", @$evens);
        say "There are " . scalar(@$odds) .  " odd numbers: " . join(" ", @$odds);
    }

    let ($max = max(@input)) {
        ...
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scope functions can be used to create small lexical scope, inside
which the results of an given expression are used, but not outside.

This module provide 2 extra keywords -- C<with> and C<let> -- for
creating creating scopes that look a little bit better than just a
bare code BLOCK.

By C<use>-ing this module without a import list, all keywords are imported.
To import only wanted keywords, specify them in the import list:

    # Import all keywords
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction;

    # Import just `let`
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction qw(let);

    # Import just `with`, and name it differently
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction 'with' => { -as 'withThese' }

Imported keywords can be removed by a C<no> statement.

    no PerlX::ScopeFunction;

=head2 C<with>

The C<with> keyword can be used to bring the result of an given EXPR
to a smaller scope (code block):

    with ( EXPR ) BLOCK

The EXPR are evaluated in list context, and the result (a list) is
available inside BLOCK as C<@_>. The conventional topic variable C<$_>
is also assigned the last value of the list (C<$_[-1]>).

=head2 C<let>

The C<let> keyword can be used to create locally readonly variables in
a smaller scope (code block). The keyword C<let> should be followed by
a list of assignment expressions, then a block.

    let ( ASSIGNMENTS ) BLOCK

The C<ASSIGNMENTS> means a list of assignment statements seperated by
semicolons, and the operator must C<=>. They are evalutade in the same
order as they are defined and becomes new, readyonly, variables are
inside the BLOCK. Variables created in the beginning of this list of
can be used in the latter positions.

If in the current scope, thee are variables with identical names as
the LHS in the ASSIGNMENTS, they are masked in the let-block.

For example, these would creating 3 new variables in the let-block
that mask the ones with identical names in the current scope.

    my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = (10, 20, 30);
    let ($foo = 1; $bar = 2; $baz = $foo + $bar) {
        say "$foo $bar $baz"; #=> 1 2 3
    }
    say "$foo $bar $baz"; #=> 10 20 30

Array and Hashes can also be created this way:

    let (@foo = (1,2,3); %bar = (bar => 1); $baz = 42) {
        ...
    }

=head1 Importing as different names

Since the keywords provided in this module are commonly defined in
other CPAN modules, this module also provides a way to let users to
import those keywords as different name, with a conventional spec also
seen in L<Sub::Exporter>.

For example, to import C<with> as C<given_these>, you say:

    use PerlX::ScopeFunction "with" => { -as => "given_these" };

Basically whenever there is a HashRef in the import list, previous
entries is imported. But C<"-as"> is the only meaningful key. All
other options seen in C<Sub::Exporter> are ignored.

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to the fact this module hooks into perl parser, the keywords
cannot be used without being imported into current namespace.
Statements like the following does not compile:

     PerlX::ScopeFunction::let( ... ) {
         ...
     }

     PerlX::ScopeFunction::with( ... ) {
         ...
     }
