=head1 NAME

PerlX::ScopeFunction - new keywords for creating scopes.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PerlX::ScopeFunction qw( let with );
    use List::Util qw( sum0 );
    use List::MoreUtils qw( part minmax );

    with ( part { $_ % 2 } @input ) {
        my ($evens, $odds) = @_;
        say "There are " . scalar(@$evens) . " even numbers: " . join(" ", @$evens);
        say "There are " . scalar(@$odds) .  " odd numbers: " . join(" ", @$odds);
    }

    let ( ($min,$max) = minmax(@input); $mean = sum0(@input)/@input ) {
        ...
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scope functions can be used to create small lexical scope, inside
which the results of an given expression are used, but not outside.

This module provide 2 extra keywords -- C<with> and C<let> -- for
creating creating scopes that look a little bit better than just a
bare code BLOCK.

By C<use>-ing this module without a import list, all keywords are imported.
To import only wanted keywords, specify them in the import list:

    # Import all keywords
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction;

    # Import just `let`
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction qw(let);

    # Import just `with`, and name it differently
    use PerlX::ScopeFunction 'with' => { -as 'withThese' }

Imported keywords can be removed by a C<no> statement.

    no PerlX::ScopeFunction;

=head2 C<with>

The C<with> keyword can be used to bring the result of an given EXPR
to a smaller scope (code block):

    with ( EXPR ) BLOCK

The EXPR are evaluated in list context, and the result (a list) is
available inside BLOCK as C<@_>. The conventional topic variable C<$_>
is also assigned the last value of the list (C<$_[-1]>).

=head2 C<let>

The C<let> keyword can be used to create readonly C<my>- variables in
a smaller scope (code block).

The keyword C<let> should be followed by a list of variable
declarations, then a block.

    let ( DECLARATIONS ) BLOCK

The word C<DECLARATIONS> here means a list of variable declaration
statements seperated by semicolons, except there must be a RHS. They
must be given without any of C<my>, C<our>, C<state> keywords.

For example, if in the BLOCK you would do these to prepare 3
convenient variables:

    my $mean = mean(@input);
    my ($min, $max) = minmax(@input);

With C<let> statements, you do this instead:

    let (
        $mean = mean(@input);
        ($min,$max) = minmax(@input);
    ) {
        ...
    }

Declaration are evaluated in the same order as they are given and all
variables declarated by this are made readonly inside the BLOCK. The
underlying library to make variables readonly is
L<Const::Fast>. Variables created in the beginning of this list of can
be used in the latter positions.

If in the current scope, there are variables with identical names as
the ones in the DECLARATIONS, they are masked in the let-block.

For example, in the following example code, 3 new variables are
created in the let-block and they the ones with identical names
outside of the let-block.

    my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = (10, 20, 30);
    let ($foo = 1; $bar = 2; $baz = $foo + $bar) {
        say "$foo $bar $baz"; #=> 1 2 3
    }
    say "$foo $bar $baz"; #=> 10 20 30

Array and Hash can also be created:

    let (@foo = (1,2,3); %bar = (bar => 1); $baz = 42) {
        ...
    }

=head1 Importing as different names

Since the keywords provided in this module are commonly defined in
other CPAN modules, this module also provides a way to let users to
import those keywords as different names, with a conventional spec also
seen in L<Sub::Exporter>.

For example, to import C<with> as C<given_these>, you say:

    use PerlX::ScopeFunction "with" => { -as => "given_these" };

Basically HashRef in import list becomes modifiers of their previous
entries. However, This module supports only the modifier C<-as> but
not other ones as seen in L<Sub::Exporter>.

=head1 CAVEATS

Due to the fact this module hooks into perl parser, the keywords
cannot be used without being imported into current namespace.
Statements like the following do not compile:

     PerlX::ScopeFunction::let( ... ) {
         ...
     }

     PerlX::ScopeFunction::with( ... ) {
         ...
     }
